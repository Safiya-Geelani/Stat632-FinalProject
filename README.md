This dataset contains the Happiness Score and Rank for 146 countries along with the factors used to explain the score. The scores are based on individuals' own assessments of their lives, as revealed by their answers to the single-item Cantril ladder life-evaluation question.
146 rows (countries) x 12 columns (including 9 different factors).
The factors are: Positive affect, Negative affect, Dystopia(1.83), GDP per capita, Social support, Healthy life expectancy, Freedom to make life choices, Generosity, Perceptions of government/ business corruption.
Positive affect the average of three positive affect measures in GWP (laugh, enjoyment, doing interesting things).
Negative affect is the average of three negative affect measures in GWP (worry, sadness, anger).
The value for Dystopia (1.83) is the predicted Cantril ladder for a hypothetical country with the world's lowest values for each of the six variables.
